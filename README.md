## What is it for?
It's a desktop application for managing a music collection, such as CDs or vinyl records in a quick and simple way. First you store the metadata however you like.
It has a music player built in, can play in FLAC, OGG and MP3. It can also sync with your Spotify. If you have Premium you can use Spotify from the app.
Doesn't require any installation, can be carried on a USB flash drive.

### Features
